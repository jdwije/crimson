The Crimson Scheme Standard Library [CSSL]
======

CSSL is a Crimson Scheme specific library that aims to provide standardized and
re-usable code for Crimsons Ruby interop features. These include convienient
wrappers for many of the Ruby Standard Library objects themselves, as well as
standard templates for wrapping up third parth ruby functionaly into native
Crimson Scheme objects. CSSL is Object Oriented and uses the POS (Portable Object
System) developed by xxx. It also includes a lot of code from the SNOW Scheme
package repository. This was combed over and relevant chunks were hand picked and
extracted. So full credit to those guys xxx ...
